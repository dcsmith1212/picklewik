Today was the big day! I got up, made the frosting for the cake and some gravy, then went over to Rose's parents' place. They were napping, so Citrus and I watched more Derry Girls, then we all went on a hike around 3. Once we got back I finished cooking dinner and holy cow everything turned out great. It was a lot of work, but a lot of fun, and it was a super rewarding and delicious meal to make! After dinner we all chilled out.
