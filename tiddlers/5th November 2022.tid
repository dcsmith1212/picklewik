Josh, Monika, Leo, and I went to Loveland this morning. First ski day of the season! We met Lily and Patrick there, and though it is early November it felt more like mid-January... Near Georgetown we hit a wall of clouds and entered what felt like a different place entirely. Like a dunce I forgot my boots so I rented them at the shop and then we lapped Mambo a few times. The wind was fierce but was at least depositing a fresh bit of snow continuously. After brats and Irish coffee at the bar, we finished off on a few more runs as the weather worsened, then finally headed back to Monika's. We capped off the trip by watching Ski School, a ridiculous 80s ski movie that it turns out the Always Sunny episode was based on (down to the model of the future resort and everything!).

I took a Lyft to the airport where security was a breeze, and I walked to a part of DIA I don't remember leaving from before, since the flight to St. George is on a tiny little airplane. After overhearing some interesting Mormon conversations on the way, and a bit of delay, we got there and Rose picked me up with some Panang Curry from a place in Hurricane. We were both beat when we got home and went straight to bed. This was a fun week, but holy cow am I a bit socialed out and exhausted.
