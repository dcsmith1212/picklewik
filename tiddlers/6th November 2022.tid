Today was a fun one. I drove out to Wire Pass to [[hike|Wire Pass to Buckskin Gulch]] over to Buckskin Gulch. Although I didn't get as far as I wanted down (or up) the canyon, it was a beautiful place. I came back home and got some groceries to make Cumin Pork inspired by Five Spice in Boulder, caught up on all the Darwin's Orchestra entries I missed while in Colorado, and took a nap. Once Rose got home I started cooking and we watched some Breaking Bad while eating dinner. She's getting close to the end! Finally we both went to sleep, still super tired from the past couple days.
