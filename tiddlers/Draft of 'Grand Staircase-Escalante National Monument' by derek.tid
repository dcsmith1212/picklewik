Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument is located in southern Utah. The monument encompasses over 1.8 million acres of geological, paleontological, and historical wonders, and can be divided into three regions:

# The Grand Staircase region is the western-most, near the towns of Kanab and Big Water, and is dominated by the Paunsaugunt Plateau / the Grand Staircase formation.
# The Kaiparowarits Plateau forms the second region, and is some of the most remote terrain in the lower 48.
