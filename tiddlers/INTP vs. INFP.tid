Since Rose tests as INFP, it is interesting to read the sections of Drenth's book about them as well, and in fact I think I straddle the line between these two types to some extent. Drenth describes the difference between the two types towards the end of //The INTP//, surmising that males of the two types often have quite a lot of behaviors in common. His proposal that INFPs are more likely to enjoy hiking and the outdoors, fiction and science fiction, as well as arts, culture, and music does resonate with me. In the end of course everyone's four type designations straddle a continuum, so while I do still feel like I tend towards INTP, it will be interesting to study further the INFPs to which I relate as well.
