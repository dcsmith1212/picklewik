Today it was back to work for the first time since Tuesday. The day was chock full of stupid Rob interactions, but other than that I helped Pete out a bit with the commands defect he was looking at, and had planning. Besides work stuff, I spent a lot of time with the wiki, finally getting my static IP address and domain hooked up to my webserver, and adding a few different environmentalist-type tiddlers related to different non-profits in southern Utah, plus adding the Colorado River Compact tiddler. Tonight Rose and I are just chilling out, and watching TV.
