title: Las Vegas Center for Vision Therapy
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The Last Vegas Center for Vision Therapy treats patients with vision issues such as strabismus and amblyopia with vision therapy. One of the doctors, Dr. Kareen Landerville, gained detailed stereopsis for the first time while in optometry school, and the center emphasizes that improvements to vision through therapy can happen at any age. I am thinking of [[requesting an appointment|https://www.lvcvt.com/contactus.php]].
