Today was a pretty sweet day. Rose's parents took Citrus to the airport while Rose and I chilled out and watched Hell's Kitchen. In the evening we went over to her parents' place before walking to Sego and HOLY CRAP it was an amazing meal. We got like 6 different small plates that were all delicious, and the mezcal cocktails were great too. Afterwards we chilled out and watched Derry Girls before heading back home. It was great spending this week with her parents. Hopefully I get to see them a bit during Christmas!
