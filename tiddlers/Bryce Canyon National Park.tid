Bryce Canyon National Park is a national park in southwestern Utah on the eastern edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau. Bryce Canyon is actually a collection of natural ampitheaters filled with red, orange, and white hoodoos formed by frost erosion. The rim of the ampitheater is at an elevation of 8,000 to 9,000 feet, so the park gets a substantial amount of snow in the winter.
