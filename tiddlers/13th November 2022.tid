Today I got up and finally hiked to [[Birthday Arch|Birthday Arch Trip, Nov. 2022]] out near Big Water. The hike was mild but very calming and beautiful, no doubt in part because of the excellent weather. After I got back to the car, I decided to go to Page for groceries at Safeway, since I was most of the way there. While at the store I picked up ingredients for [[Braised Short Rib]] and [[Mushroom Risotto]], after my dad was telling me about the same dishes he made the other day. I also found fresh masa at the Safeway, made in Arizona, which is rad! The diversity of New Mexico and Arizona really is awesome, and I'm glad to live so close to Page.

I headed back home, binging more of the Always Sunny podcast, and when I got home I whipped up the simple gnocchi / vodka sauce dish for dinner, since I didn't want to spend much time cooking. Rose ended up getting home super late, so I got through a bunch of The Watchmen before she made it home. Book club is on Tuesday for that, and I have a lot of reading left to do.
