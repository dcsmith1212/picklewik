title: Seared Ahi Tuna Steaks
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

//''Prep'' 10 mins. ''Cook'' 5 mins. ''Servings'' 2.//

! Ingredients

* 2 ahi tuna (yellowfin tuna) steaks (about 4 oz. each, 1" thick - see notes for thinner or thicker)
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil see notes
* 1 tablespoon honey see notes
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper to taste
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
* 1 tablespoon canola oil or olive oil
* green onions, toasted sesame seeds, and lime wedges for serving (optional)


! Instructions

# Pat the ahi tuna steaks dry with a paper towel. Place on a plate or inside a plastic bag.
# Mix the soy sauce (2 tablespoons), toasted sesame oil (1 tablespoon), honey (1 tablespoon) kosher salt (1/2 teaspoon- OMIT if marinating for more than a couple hours, see notes), pepper (1/4 teaspoon), and cayenne pepper (1/4 teaspoon) until honey is fully dissolved. Pour over the ahi tuna steaks and turn over to coat completely. Optional: allow to marinate for at least 10 minutes, or up to overnight in the refrigerator. Also optional: Reserve a spoonful or two of the marinade before coating the fish for drizzling on top after you've cooked it.
# Heat a medium skillet (preferably non-stick or a well-seasoned cast iron skillet) on medium-high to high until very hot ( or medium medium-high for nonstick). I recommend giving cast iron 3-5 minutes to get hot and nonstick about 1 minute, depending on how thick it is.
# Add the canola oil (1 tablespoon) to the hot pan. Sear the tuna for 1 - 1½ minutes on each side for medium rare ( 2 -2½ minutes for medium-well to well, 30 seconds for very rare. See notes - this will vary based on thickness of the tuna steaks). (Note: different burners get hotter depending on your stove. Use your best judgement whether you use medium, medium-high, or high heat, as the marinade may burn if too high heat is used)
# Remove to a cutting board. Slice into 1/2 inch slices and serve garnished with green onions, toasted sesame seeds, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice, if desired.
