The last day of November! Today I mostly planned for my trip to the Escalante and started packing up. It's so hard to decided what to do because there is so much out there, but I think I will go to [[Reflection Canyon]] and mess around on the mesa for a while. If I have the time and energy I might go look at [[Cathedral in the Desert]] too.

Tonight Rose and I just chilled and had dinner and watched Hell's Kitchen.
