Today was a big day down in St. George. Rose had her first psychiatrist appointment with the new guy which she was super nervous about. I dropped her off there and went over to the Book Bungalow and picked up a book about [[tenkara|Tenkara]], then went back and got her from the appointment. It went great! Sounds like he has no doubts about her ADHD and already has some things he'd like to try for her prescription.

After that we picked up Citrus at the airport and headed back home. On the way we decided to stop at the brewery in Colorado City which was eh, but I'm glad it exists at least. We got back and ate some red beans and rice that her parents made, and chilled out for the rest of the evening.
