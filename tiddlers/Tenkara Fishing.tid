title: Tenkara Fishing
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Tenkara is a traditional style of rod angling from Japan. Typically practiced in mountain streams, this style of fishing has some similarities to Western-style fly fishing except with the use of reel-less rods. Traditionally Tenkara used real insects as bait, though it is common nowadays to use artificial Japanese flies. Tenkara has not historically been very popular, especially outside of Japan, but over the last decade or two it has grown increasingly popular in the West as a means of simplifying the practice of fly fishing and minimizing the amount of gear needed to do it.
