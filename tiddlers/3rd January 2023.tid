Today I started testing the XTopic changes with Alex. I am testing the vocab side of things. I also have been continuing to work through Chapter 13 of [[HSoM|The Haskell School of Music]], taking my time to really understand the grammar code as I think this could be fun to mess with in the future. In that vein, I've been listening to a bunch of ambient music and would love start making my own generative, ambient computer music too.
