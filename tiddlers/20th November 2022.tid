Rose took off yesterday and today, so it's been great spending the real weekend with her. Today we got up late and went to the bakery, then headed over to her parents' for breakfast. After chilling out for a bit we went on a hike in [[Parunuweap|Parunuweap Canyon, Utah]] up [[Bay Bill Canyon|Bay Bill Canyon Trip, Nov. 2022]], which I'd done a little stretch of previously, but this time we went most of the way up it and it was awesome. Afterwards we went to the Maynard Dixon gallery but they were closed, so we just went home and got dinner at Rocking V. We were all pretty beat after yesterday's partying so we just watched a long western movie and went to bed pretty early.
