Today I fixed up a few loose ends and edge case issues with P-rex. I think we're pretty much done with that item, other than fixing a unit test. So that feels good! I also [[read a bunch of Kindred|Kindred and helplessness as a slave]], which has been really great. This evening I made roasted chicken legs for dinner, and Rose and I finished Breaking Bad! Man, even though I just watched that whole show, it is still so entertaining to see it again, especially vicariously through Rose seeing it for the first time.
