Today we had an engineering meeting in the morning that was just a casual discussion, really, and I set up my new work laptop while people were talking. Afterwards we went to boulder for lunch at Rio Grande and then went to the escape room. Both were super fun! And our team was the only one to get out on time ;)

Afterwards I went over to Angie's and we hung out for a while, got dinner, and had a few drinks. She is having a rough time after the last chemo treatment. Hopefully the next one (the final one of the first round) isn't too heinous.
