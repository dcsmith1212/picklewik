title: Map (higher-order function)
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

In programming languages, a map takes a collection of data and applies and operation to its elements, returns a collection of the same size that has been modified element-wise. Maps are common in functional languages as a replacement for loops, and they are also integral to languages like MATLAB to applied functions to large collections efficiently. In Haskell, the call `map square [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` will return the list `[1,4,9,16,25]`.
