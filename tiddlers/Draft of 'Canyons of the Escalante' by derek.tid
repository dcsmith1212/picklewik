The canyon system of the Escalante River and its tributaries is located in south central Utah. These canyons form the northeastern-most section of [[Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument]] with portions of the canyons inhabiting [[Glen Canyon National Recreational Area]] as well. The canyons, whose streams and rivers begin in the [[Aquarius Plateau]] and drain into Glen Canyon, provide access to many hoodoos, arches, natural bridges, ampitheaters, and other geological wonders.
