Today I [[went for a hike out|Lower Hackberry Trip, Nov. 2022]] in the Hackberry Creek area. It was super fun and the area was beautiful, but hiking through the frigid creek kinda took it out of me. After getting back home I watched a bunch of Always Sunny, set up the Christmas tree, and then Rose and I met Rani at Iron Horse for Karaoke night. Now we're back home chilling out.
