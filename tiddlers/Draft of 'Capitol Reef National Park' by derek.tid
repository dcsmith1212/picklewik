Capitol Reef National Park is located in south central Utah. The 60-mile long park protects more than half of the Waterpocket Fold, a 100-mile long spine stretching from [[Glen Canyon|Glen Canyon National Recreational Area]] to the San Rafael Swell. The park is in the heart of redrock country and contains many canyons, buttes, and monoliths.
