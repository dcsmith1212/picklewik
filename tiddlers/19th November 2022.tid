Today Rose and I went to Page for most of the day. We stopped at The Birdhouse for lunch and went to Walmart to get supplies for Thanksgiving. Then we went to Horseshoe Bend which was stunningly beautiful although crowded. Her parents came into town this evening and we went over there to hang out and catch up. It is great to see them again!
