Today I was supposed to be working, but mostly I prepped for Thanksgiving by making some of the food ahead of time. I did the two pies, the pumpkin cake, prepped the green bean casserole and stuffing, and spatchcocked and herbed the turkey. In the evening we had a nice dinner at Rose's parents' place and then watched more Derry Girls.
