Today I finished the majority of the changes for integrating P-rex, including a few things to get the JNI built and its .so transferred to the Windows build machine for the SVP build. Checking in these changes is a little daunting, but I will do it tomorrow. After work I heated up some cumin pork (yum!) and Rose and I watched some Breaking Bad. She's almost done with the show! I read a little Kindred before falling asleep.
