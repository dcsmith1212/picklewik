title: String Harmonics
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

All musical instruments produce a tone comprised of a fundamental frequency and and overlying series of overtones from the [[harmonic series|Harmonic Series]]. The relative weight each of these overtones contributes to the overall tone is what gives each instrument its particular timbre. For stringed instruments, these overtones can be isolated by playing string harmonics, and this technique is achieved by lightly touching the string at fractions of its length. For example, touching a guitar string at 1/2 its length (i.e. the 12th fret) will remove the fundamental frequency and all other odd-number overtones in the series, leaving only those with a node at the middle of the string.
