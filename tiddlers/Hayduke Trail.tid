The Hayduke Trail is an 800-mile route through the five national parks in Utah and the Grand Canyon in Arizona, plus Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, Glen Canyon National Recreational Area, and a number of wilderness areas and other BLM districts across Southern Utah and Northern Arizona. It is truly an all-encompassing trek that showcases some of the region's most stunning, varied terrain.
