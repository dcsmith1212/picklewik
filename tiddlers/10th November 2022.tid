Today was a big meeting day. We discussed integrating the mini-topics Charles and Richard have been working on, which will be a super interesting / revolutionary bit of code to transition towards, I think. We also had planning and pulled in a few easy API docs items. After work I finished Kindred and Monika and I hopped on the call for bookclub, but Steph ended up sleeping through it so we're going to meet next week. She must be exhausted with teaching AND grad school!

But on the call Monika and I got to talking about climbing and skiing and I saw on Brian Head's website that they got 25 inches in the last 48 hours. 25 INCHES! So I looked at Paylocity and also discovered I have twice as much PTO left as I thought... 10.5 days! So I'm going to take off tomorrow to go skiing! I'M SO EXCITED!
