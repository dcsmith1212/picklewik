In functional programming, a fold is an operation which recursively applies an operation to a collection of data in order to combine the collection into a value of some kind. For example. summing the values in a list could be done via a fold by accumulating the intermediate sums of its values while recursing over them.

If a list is thought of as a series of nested `cons` nodes as is done in many functional languages (i.e. `[1,2,3]` as `(cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 ([]))))`, then a fold can be thought of as replacing the `cons` with another operation, and the terminating empty list with a specific value. In the case of summing a list, the replacement operation is `+` and the "starting" value is 0.
