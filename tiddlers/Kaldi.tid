Kaldi is an open-source speech recognition and signal processing toolkit written in C++. The toolkit is comprised of a highly modular `src` directory which includes code for training a variety of statistical learning models and deep neural networks, for beam search decoding and lattice generation for real-time speech processing, for acoustical transforms such an mfcc, fbank, and fMLLR, and much more. Kaldi also includes an `egs` directory containing recipes for training various types of acoustic models on different datasets. Kaldi is built on the OpenFST library, and uses [[FSTs|Finite-State Tranducer]] in a wide variety of contexts.
