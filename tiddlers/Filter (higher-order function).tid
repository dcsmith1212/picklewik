title: Filter (higher-order function)
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

In functional programming, a filter applies an operation to a collection of data, returning a collection of the same type that may contain a subset of the original collection. For example, in Haskell `filter even [1..10]` will take the input list an filter out those that are odd, returning `[2,4,6,8,10]`.
