title: Response to Glen Canyon essay
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A few weeks ago I read [[When the desert runs dry]], a long-form essay about the past, present, and future of [[Lake Powell and Glen Canyon|Glen Canyon National Recreational Area]] amidst a time of elongated droughts and growing water consumption in the West. The paper was well-researched and provided some insight into the original [[Colorado River Compact|Law of the River]] and how Lake Powell's waters are supposed to server the states in the [[Colorado River Basin]]. In fact, the essay presents a more journalistic take on the [[research|A Future on Borrowed Time]] of the [[Utah Rivers Council]] surrounding the Basin's lowering water flow and how it may affect states in the area. 

Apart from the legality of water division between Basin states, as Lake Powell's waters lower it begs the question: what will happen to the tourist economy of the area? I for one am excited at the prospect of some or all of Glen Canyon draining of floodwaters, revealing many of the geologic wonders that have been buried since the dam was created. Perhaps being flexible to this transition is the best way we can cope with an ever-drying desert environment. Perhaps the dam was never the right way to provide water to Basin states to begin with, and we can right a wrong.
