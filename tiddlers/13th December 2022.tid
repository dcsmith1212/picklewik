This past weekend Rose and I met my parents in Vegas. The National Finals Rodeo was going on, so there was a cowboy theme to the whole weekend. We had some amazing meals, did some shopping, got some delicious drinks, and generally had a great time. But Rose and I ended up getting sick and tested positive for COVID yesterday, which is why I haven't journaled in a few days. Womp womp. Hopefully we get to feeling better soon, this has been quite a crummy illness.
