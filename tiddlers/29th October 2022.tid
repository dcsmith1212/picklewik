Today was the travel and party day. Rose and I got up early and headed for Vegas. Holy cow was the drive epic. We've drive to St. George a few times now, but I still love seeing the Pine Valley, Beaver Dam, and Virgin Mountain Ranges off in the distance past the drop off down to Hurricane. But this time we kept going and actually went //through// the Beaver Dam wilderness. It is a striking area, quite rugged and desolate but the mountains are pretty immense. Then once we emerged onto the basin in Arizona, we had views of the Mormon Mountains and other ranges off in Nevada, plus we drove by Valley of Fire State Park in Nevada. Finally we drove into the basin containing Vegas itself, with Red Rocks and those colossal 11ers in the distance behind it. There are a lot of fun places to explore along that corridor.
