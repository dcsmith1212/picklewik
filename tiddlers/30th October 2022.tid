Well, the Halloween party was a blast. On the way back from the airport Josh took us by Arc so I could find some shoes for the Fred costume, and we found the perfect ones. After chilling at Monika's for a while, people started to show up and I had a great time talking to the Crestoners, the Mines kids, and everyone else.

Today we all felt like garbage, as expected. We crawled to a diner near Monika's place and ordered some greasy food piles, then went back home to watch a bunch of outdoorsy videos (Gorging, G.N.A.R., Steep), a scary movie, and capped off the night watching a young Joe Rogan host a couple sleazy episodes of Fear Factor. All in all, a good recovery day from the party the night before.
