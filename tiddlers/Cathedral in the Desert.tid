Cathedral in the Desert is a natural ampitheater located in [[Glen Canyon National Recreational Area]] within Clear Creek canyon, a small arm off the Escalante River canyon. The colossal ampitheater has been under the waters of Lake Powell for most of the reservoir's existence, but over the past couple years it has drained, revealing a larger waterfall pour off.
