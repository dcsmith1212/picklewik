Happy New Year! After being MIA for the second half of December due to illness and travel, I'm back online. Yesterday I went to Brian Head for the second time this season, since they have been getting a bunch of snow the past couple days. Today I'm resting my quads and reading more of [[HSoM|The Haskell School of Music]]. The first half of the book has been fairly interesting. I like this approach to learning Haskell, as it presents ideas when they're needed and gives practical examples of how to use them. So far though, the music that has come out of these programs is pretty lame, but we're starting to talk about stochastic and generative composition, which is where I think I'll get a lot of value.
