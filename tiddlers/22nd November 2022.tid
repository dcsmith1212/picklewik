Today I worked with Alex to confirm that the supposed issue with the patch build last week was just something with Bruce's vocab tester. So those patch changes could have been released. Ah well, I'm just glad to be back on 18.0 stuff. 

In the evening we went with Rose's family to Wild Thyme for a tasty dinner, and chilled out afterwards and watched some Derry Girls.
